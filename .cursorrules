Project: max-site (/Users/maxhunter/Projects/max-site)
Purpose: A fun, stylish project by Max to showcase tools and games. Deployed on GCP Firebase (Hosting).

Stack
- React 19 + React Router 7 (`react-router-dom`)
- Vite (+ `@vitejs/plugin-react`)
- ESLint 9

Routes
- `/` Home
- `/games` Games
- `/about` About
- `/projects/physics` PhysicsSandbox (canvas)
- `/projects/maze` MazeGame (canvas)

Conventions
- Each route lives in its own folder under `src/pages` with component, CSS, and helpers co-located to keep game logic isolated per page.
- Global/shared CSS lives in `src/styles/`:
  - `base.css` (defaults), `layout.css` (containers/hero), `components.css` (UI primitives), `typography.css` (text utilities)
- Component-specific CSS stays co-located (e.g., `src/components/navbar.css`)
- Prefer using shared classes from `src/styles` before adding new CSS
- Keep `.page` container; Navbar spans full width with centered inner content
- Do not add comments unless they convey meaningful, non-obvious intent or critical context.

Build/Preview/Deploy
- `npm run dev` — dev server
- `npm run build` — outputs to `dist/`
- `npm run preview` — preview build
- Firebase Hosting: `public: dist`, SPA rewrite to `/index.html`; deploy via `firebase deploy`

Assistant
- Be concise; only necessary fenced code
